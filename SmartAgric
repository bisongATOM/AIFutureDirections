AI-Driven IoT – Smart Agriculture System
System Overview
An AI-powered IoT system that monitors field conditions and predicts crop yield to optimize irrigation, fertilization, and harvest timing.

Sensors Required

Purpose
Frequency
Soil Moisture Sensor
Measure water content in root zone
Every 15 min
Temperature/Humidity
Monitor microclimate (air)
Every 10 min
Light Intensity (LDR)
Assess photosynthesis potential
Hourly
pH Sensor
Evaluate soil acidity
Daily
Rainfall Gauge
Track natural irrigation
Real-time
NDVI Camera (Drone)
Assess plant health via vegetation index

AI Model for Crop Yield Prediction
Model Choice: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Network

Why? Crop growth depends on temporal sequences (e.g., cumulative rainfall over weeks).
Input Features: Time-series data from sensors (7–30 days window)
Output: Predicted yield (kg/ha) at harvest
Training Data: Historical sensor logs + actual yields from past seasons
Alternative: Hybrid model (CNN for drone imagery + LSTM for sensor data)
