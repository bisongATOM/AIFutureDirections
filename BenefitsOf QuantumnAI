Quantum AI vs. Classical AI in Optimization
Classical AI for Optimization:
Uses algorithms like gradient descent, genetic algorithms, or simulated annealing running on classical bits (0 or 1). Effective for many problems but struggles with combinatorial explosion—e.g., evaluating all possible routes in logistics (Traveling Salesman Problem) becomes infeasible as variables grow.

Quantum AI for Optimization:
Leverages quantum mechanics (superposition, entanglement, tunneling) via qubits. Quantum algorithms like Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) or Quantum Annealing can explore vast solution spaces in parallel. For certain problems, they offer exponential speedups or better solutions in less time.

Key Differences:

Feature
Classical AI
Quantum AI
Data Unit
Bits (0 or 1)

Experimental (NISQ-era devices)
Industries That Could Benefit Most:

Logistics & Supply Chain: Optimizing delivery routes, warehouse management.
Finance: Portfolio optimization, risk analysis, arbitrage opportunities.
Pharmaceuticals: Molecular simulation for drug discovery (optimizing binding energies).
Energy: Grid optimization, fusion reactor configuration.
Aerospace: Mission trajectory planning with multiple constraints.
