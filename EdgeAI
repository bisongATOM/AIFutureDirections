Q1: Edge AI vs. Cloud-Based AI – Latency and Privacy
Edge AI refers to the deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms directly on local devices (e.g., smartphones, drones, IoT sensors) rather than relying on remote cloud servers.

Latency Reduction:
In cloud-based AI, data must be transmitted to a centralized server for processing, introducing network delays due to bandwidth limitations, distance, and congestion. Edge AI eliminates this round-trip communication: inference happens locally in real time. This is critical for time-sensitive applications where milliseconds matter.

Privacy Enhancement:
Cloud AI typically requires uploading raw user data (e.g., images, voice recordings) to third-party servers, raising concerns about data breaches, surveillance, and compliance (e.g., GDPR). Edge AI keeps sensitive data on-device. Only processed insights (not raw data) may be shared, minimizing exposure.

Real-World Example – Autonomous Drones:
Consider a drone performing real-time obstacle avoidance in a forest fire zone. Using Edge AI:

Onboard vision models detect trees, flames, or people instantly.
No dependency on unstable or unavailable cellular networks.
Sensitive geolocation and visual data never leave the drone, preserving operational secrecy and civilian privacy.
In contrast, cloud-based processing would introduce dangerous delays and risk leaking mission-critical data during transmission.
